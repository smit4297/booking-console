I'll help you document the process of creating and modifying the IRCTC API package for train booking in Markdown format.

## IRCTC API Package Workflow

### Initial Setup

```bash
cd {dir}
npm i 
node ./book.mjs
```

### Package Evolution

#### Original Package: `irctc-api`
- Initial implementation of IRCTC train booking functionality
- Served as the foundational package for train ticket booking

#### Modified Version: `train-book-console`
- Derived from the original `irctc-api` package
- Customized and adapted for current project requirements
- Likely includes additional features or modifications specific to the current use case

### Key Changes

1. **Source**: 
   - Original: `./book.mjs`
